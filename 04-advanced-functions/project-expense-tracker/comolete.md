## 📝 Study Tips

1. **Practice functional thinking** - Think in terms of data transformations
2. **Use HOFs daily** - map, filter, reduce should be second nature
3. **Explain closures** - If you can explain it, you understand it
4. **Refactor to composition** - Practice breaking complex functions apart
5. **Build more projects** - Apply these concepts in everything
6. **Read functional libraries** - Study lodash, ramda source code

## 🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Are these concepts used in real jobs?
**A:** Absolutely! React uses closures for hooks, Redux uses HOFs, functional programming is everywhere.

### Q: Should I always use arrow functions?
**A:** No! Use regular functions for methods that need 'this', constructors, and when you need 'arguments'.

### Q: Is composition better than inheritance?
**A:** For many cases, yes! "Composition over inheritance" is a key principle.

### Q: When should I use currying?
**A:** When you need configurable functions, reusable logic, or partial application.
