## 📝 Study Tips

1. **Arrays are everywhere** - Most data in web apps is in arrays
2. **Objects organize data** - Use them to group related properties
3. **Practice array methods** - map/filter/forEach are super important
4. **Loops are powerful** - But choose the right one for the job
5. **Build projects** - Best way to cement learning
